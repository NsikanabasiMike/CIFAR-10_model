## Project Title
CIFAR-10_Image_Classifier_project

## Description
This project is about building a neural network to classify and evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CIFAR dataset is an inbuilt dataset in torchvision library.
It has about ten classes of images: plane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck. These images have 32 X 32 dimension.

## Aim
1. To build a model for predicting CIFAR-10 dataset

2. To achieve an accuracy greater than 45%.
3. To beat Detectocorp's benchmark accuracy of 70%

## Credits
1. Python was used for data wrangling.
2. Matplotlib library was used for visualization.
3. CIFAR-10 dataset from torchvision library was used
